### [Document Atlas](http://docatlas.ijs.si)

Document Atlas is utility for visualizing large corpora of text documents. The whole
corpus is projected onto a 2D plane using a combination of latent semantic indexing and
multidimensional scaling. The user can explore the 2D plane using an intuitive interface.
The density of documents is used for generating the background relief in order to make
the visualization of documents similar to a map. Keywords describing specific areas are
also written on the map. All these features together provide the user with an easier
path towards understanding the corpus.
